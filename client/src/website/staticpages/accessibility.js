    <p className='text-gray-700 font-semibold text-3xl'>Statement of Commitment</p>
    <p className='text-gray-700'>
    Eighty 8 Alpha Automotive Inc. is on a mission to revolutionize the way people buy and sell used cars. We are committed to providing a barrier-free and integrated environment so that everyone has equal access to the products and services that Eighty 8 Alpha Automotive Inc. provides. We’re committed to meeting the needs of people with disabilities, and will ensure that we comply with the standards under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) in a timely fashion.
    </p>
 
    <p className='text-gray-700 font-semibold text-3xl'>Accessibility Policy</p>
    <p className='text-gray-700 font-semibold text-2xl'>Purpose:</p>
    <p className='text-gray-700'>
    We have created an Accessibility Policy (“Policy”) to fulfill the goal of the AODA which is to create a more accessible Ontario by identifying and, to the extent possible, preventing and eliminating barriers experienced by any persons with a disability including employees of Eighty 8 Alpha Automotive Inc. and members of the public. Our Policy is also designed to comply with the Customer Service Standards (the “Standards”) to ensure goods and services are, where possible, equally accessible to every member of the public.
    </p>


    <p className='text-gray-700 font-semibold text-2xl'>Application:</p>
    <p className='text-gray-700'>
    Our Policy applies to all Eighty 8 Alpha Automotive Inc. services provided to the public and to everyone at Eighty 8 Alpha Automotive Inc. who provides services to the public.
    </p>

    <p className='text-gray-700 font-semibold text-2xl'>Core Principles of Our Policy: </p>
    <p className='text-gray-700'>

     We endeavor to ensure that our Policy and related practices and procedures are consistent with the following principles:
    </p>

    <p className='text-gray-700 text-2xl'>1. Dignity: </p>
    <p className='text-gray-700'>
    Persons with a disability should be treated as valued customers, as deserving of high-quality service as anyone else.
    </p>

    <p className='text-gray-700 text-2xl'>2. Equality of Opportunity:  </p>
    <p className='text-gray-700'>
    Persons with a disability should be given opportunities equal to those given to others to obtain, use, and benefit from our goods and services.
    </p>

    <p className='text-gray-700 text-2xl'>3. Integration: </p>
    <p className='text-gray-700'>
    Wherever possible, persons with a disability should benefit from our goods and services in the same or similar place and in the same or similar manner as any other customer. In circumstances where integration does not serve the needs of a person with a disability, goods and services should, to the extent possible, be provided in another way that takes into account the person’s individual needs.
    </p>

    <p className='text-gray-700 text-2xl'>4. Independence:</p>
    <p className='text-gray-700'>
    Goods and services should be provided in a way that respects the independence of persons with a disability. While we should always be willing to assist a person with a disability, we should not do so without the express permission of that person.
    </p>

    <p className='text-gray-700'>
    Eighty 8 Alpha Automotive Inc. is committed to providing excellent customer service, including to customers with disabilities, and we will carry out our functions and responsibilities as follows:

    <p className='text-gray-700'>
    Eighty 8 Alpha Automotive Inc. is committed to providing effective communication with people with disabilities. We recognize that different individuals may have different communication needs and we will work with each person with a disability to determine what method of communication works best for them.

    Eighty 8 Alpha Automotive Inc. welcomes the use of personal assistive devices by people with disabilities. We will ensure that our staff is trained to assist customers with disabilities who require assistive devices.
