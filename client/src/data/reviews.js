        "comment":"I purchased my new car from Cutch. It was no hassle, no sales pitch, super easy, quick deal. I received the vehicle in a very clean manner with a full tank of gas. Our mechanic confirmed the car is in great shape. I never purchased a car online before and especially not a used one without driving it first but here you get the car and can return it for full refund if it's not what you hoped it would be. Mechanic confirmation just sealed the deal for me. I am happy with my car and the process of buying it.",
